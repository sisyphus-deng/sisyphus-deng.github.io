All the computers in the lab is Mac. Since then, I was used to MacOS and already setup a  productive pipeline for my daily use. Also, I have paid some on softwares, such as Alfred, omniGraffle, omniFocus, etc. I think windows 10 is also great OS, however, for me it was too time-consuming to switch back to windows.\n\nRecently, I feel 8gb+256gb of my MacBook Pro MF840 (Retina, early 2015) is not enough for me and MacBook Pro is very hard and expensive to update. I planned to by a Mac mini. While I am waiting for a deal, I found this HP 17-x173dx in my storage room. I bought it last year at best buy, just because it was cheap, but I have never used it. After I briefly checked the specs, it might be great for Hackintosh.\n\nActually, I am not familiar with Hackintosh, and my purpose is easy -- build up a MacOS workstation at home. Thus, I didn't make everything working today. \n\n### Not working\n- Wireless\n\t- Realtek RTK8188EE\n\t- There is no support for Realtek yet\n\t- I used is as a desktop so that it is not a big deal. Maybe fix it with BT4.0 later.\n- Camera\n- Audio\n\t- Partially works \n\t- The max volume is a little low\n\t- It does not auto switch to headphone when plugged\n\t- The voodooDdaSettingsLoader has some permission problems\n\n### [Specs](https://support.hp.com/us-en/document/c05447632)\n* i7-7500U\n* 8 GB DDR4\n* Intel HD Graphics 620\n* Samsung EVO 850 1 TB \n\t* It comes a 1 TB Blue disk 5400rpm.\n\t* I am planing buy a hard drive caddy and put the old hard drive for larger\n* 17.3'' HD+ LED (1600 x 900)\n\nWe need determine some details of the computer.  I used a USB drive with live linux to do this (Maybe it can be done in windows but I am not familiar with windows and I happen to have a [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/get-manjaro/) as live linux drive burned by [etcher](https://etcher.io/) . Then start linux on the computer. Open a terminal and input commands below.\n\nCheck information about audio, wireless, graphics...\n```bash\nlspci -nn\n```\nCheck keyboard and trackpad information\n```bash\ncat /proc/bus/input/devices\n# Or for shorter\ncat /proc/bus/input/devices|grep name\n```\nWe found more details, so that we can download kext (driver) later.\n- [x] Ethernet RLT8101/2/6E, there is a drive.\n- [ ]Wireless RLT8188EE\n- [x]Sound card was Intel Sunrise Point-LP HD Audio\n- [x] PS/2 trackpad and keyboard\n\n\n### Process\nBasically, follow the [installation guide on tonymax86](https://www.tonymacx86.com/threads/unibeast-install-macos-high-sierra-on-any-supported-intel-based-pc.235474/). We need a USB drive (>16gb) and a set of USB keyboard/mouse, before we install the PS/2 drive we can't use the keyboard and trackpad on the laptop.\n1. Download High Sierra from App Store\n2. Format the USB driver\nUsing command line can prevent some GUID problems, especially the usb drive was formatted and used in windows or other system before.\n```bash\n# Find your driver\ndiskutil list\n# Say your driver is disk3, format the driver to HFS and named as MacOS.\ndiskutil eraseDisk HFS+ MacOS GPT /dev/disk3\n```\n3. Download [UniBeast](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/categories/tonymacx86-downloads.3/) and run it, I got [UniBeast 8.3.2](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/unibeast-8-3-2.383/) on 06/24/18. UniBeast will created a installation disk for you.\n3.0 You need a tonymacx account to download it. \n3.1 I selected UEFI Boot Mode.\n3.2 Don't select anything Graphics Configuration.\n3.3 Maybe take 10-20mins to get it done.\n4. Copy [MultiBeast](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/categories/tonymacx86-downloads.3/), [KextBeast](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/categories/other-archive.9/), [EFI Mounter](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/categories/other-archive.9/), [RealtekRTL8100 driver](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/259-realtekrtl8100-binary/), [Voodoo PS/2 controller driver](https://github.com/RehabMan/OS-X-Voodoo-PS2-Controller) to the USB drive.\n4.1 MultiBeast will install the bootload and drivers for you after your Hackintosh installed. I got [MultiBeast 8.3.2](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/multibeast-high-sierra-10-3-0.388/) on 06/24/18. \n4.2 KextBeast is a kext installer. I got [KextBeast](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/kextbeast.32/) on 06/24/18.\n4.3 EFI Mounter will mount EFI drive and we can edit the clover config. I got [EFI Mounter 3](https://www.tonymacx86.com/resources/efi-mounter-v3.280/) on 06/24/18.\n4.4 I got [RealtekRTL8100 driver 2.0.0](https://www.insanelymac.com/forum/files/file/259-realtekrtl8100-binary/) on 06/24/18. \n4.5 I got [Voodoo PS/2 controller driver](https://bitbucket.org/RehabMan/os-x-voodoo-ps2-controller/downloads/RehabMan-Voodoo-2018-0506.zip)  on 06/24/18.\n5. Get into BIOS by pressing F10 while booting. \n5.1 Disable security start up.\n5.2 Disable Virtualization Technology\n5.3 Disable CFG\n6. Start the installation with usb drive.\n7. You may need to format the hard drive.\n```bash\n# Find your driver, again.\ndiskutil list\n# In most case, your driver is disk0, format the driver to HFS and named as MacOS.\ndiskutil eraseDisk HFS+ MacOS GPT /dev/disk0\n```\n8. Then install the OS. There were several restarts during installation.\n9. After installation, restart the machine with USB and add option `-disablegfxfirmware`. That will prevent the grey screen during restart. \n10. Run the MultiBeast. Select UEFI and in the drive tap select the latest version of VoodooHDA. I got 2.9.0 in 06/24/18.\n11. Run EFI Mounter 3. Then get edit the clover `/EFI/CLOVER/config.plist`. Change the Intel video injection to false. (This is confusing. I found when this is on. OS can't be started.)\n12. Install the RealtekRTL8100 driver with with KextBeast.\n13. Install the VoodooPS2Controller.kext with KextBeast and copy the VoodooPS2Daemon in the folder to `/usr/bin`\n14. Restart. All DONE!!!\n\n### Todo\n- Repair the voodooDdaSettingsLoader problem\n- Add BT4.0 and repair the wireless\n\t- The orgianl wireless card looks like a M.2 card but some documents show it was half pci-e.\n\t-  There are some cards shows compatible. \n\t\t- half pci-e: BCM943224HMP\n\t\t- M.2 / NGFF: BCM94352Z\n","tags":["HP"],"categories":["MacOS"]},{"title":"Start script for deploy a centOS with XFCE on Vultr","url":"/2018/06/21/vultr_starup/","content":"Those codes is to deploy a xfce4 desktop evironment on centos.
